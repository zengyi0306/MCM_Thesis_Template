Problem A(MCM):

Predictions of Ozone Depletion

Ozone depletion includes several phenomena observed since the late 1970s: a steady decline in the total amount of ozone in Earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone — as known as ozone hole — around Earth's polar regions. In addition to these well-known stratospheric phenomena, there are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events.

It is believed that the primary cause of ozone depletion is the presence of chlorine-containing source gases, including CFCs and related halocarbons, nitrous oxide, etc. In 1985, 20 nations signed the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. In 1987, representatives from 43 nations signed the Montreal Protocol. At Montreal, the participants agreed to freeze production of CFCs at 1986 levels and to reduce production by 50 percent by 1999.

Since the adoption and strengthening of the Montreal Protocol has led to reductions in the emissions of CFCs, atmospheric concentrations of the most-significant compounds have been declining. Please develop a mathematical model to predict the ozone levels over the next 50 years.
